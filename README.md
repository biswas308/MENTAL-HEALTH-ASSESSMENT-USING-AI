Mental health is a cornerstone of overall well-being, yet millions worldwide struggle with conditions
like anxiety, depression, and stress, often in silence. Traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on
self-reporting and clinical evaluations, which face significant barriers such as stigma,
limited access to specialists, and delayed interventions. In low-resource settings, these challenges are
exacerbated by the scarcity of mental health professionals and the prohibitive costs of treatment. The
urgency for scalable, affordable, and stigma-free solutions has never been greater.
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) to bridge this gap. By analyzing textual or
speech-based inputs, our system identifies patterns indicative of mental health conditions such as
depression, anxiety, or emotional distress. Unlike conventional approaches, this tool operates
autonomously, enabling early detection through features like predictive modeling, personalized risk
scoring, and real-time monitoring.
